Payload:  When data is sent over the Internet, each unit transmitted includes both header information and the actual
	data being sent. The header identifies the source and destination of the packet, while the actual data is
 	referred to as the payload. Because header information, or overhead data, is only used in the transmission
 	process, it is stripped from the packet when it reaches its destination. Therefore, the payload is the only
 	data received by the destination system.

**Port:** A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535. port number is always associated with an IP address 
		of a host and the type of transport protocol used for communication.
		
**NAT Gateway: **A NAT gateway uses ports 1024â€“65535. This is the limit actually 65536 connections for each Remote Host.

-------------------------------

**User Space** - It is set of locations where normal user processes run. These processes can't access kernal space directly. Some part of kernal space can be accessed 
			via system calls.These system calls acts as software interrupts in kernal space.

**Kernel Space -** kernal runs in the dedicated part of memory. Role of kernal space is to manage applications/ processes running in user space. It can access 
			all the memory. If a process perform a system call, a software interrupt is sent to kernal which then dispatches an appropriate interrupt handler.
